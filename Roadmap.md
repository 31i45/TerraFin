# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Concept Mapping and Theoretical Validation
At the very beginning, we'll focus on mapping out the core concepts of TerraFin and validating the theoretical foundation through deep research and analysis. We'll be digging into what works and what doesn't, making sure we have a solid base to build on.

## Phase 2: Serving Individuals and Families with Handwritten Notebooks or Excel
In this stage, we'll start small and simple. We'll offer basic financial management tools using things like handwritten notebooks or Excel to help individuals and families get a handle on their finances. It's all about taking those first steps and making a difference in everyday money management.

## Phase 3: Serving Self-Employed Individuals and Micro-Businesses
As we grow, we'll expand our reach to support self-employed folks and micro-businesses. We'll add more features and functionality to meet their specific needs and help them thrive financially.

## Phase 4: Becoming a Professional Enterprise Financial Management Platform
Finally, our ultimate goal is to transform TerraFin into a full-fledged, professional enterprise financial management platform. We want to provide comprehensive and powerful solutions for businesses of all sizes, making financial management a breeze.
