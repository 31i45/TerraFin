# TerraFin

Hey there! My wife and I came up with TerraFin because, let's face it, managing our family finances was a total nightmare. There we were, with incomes coming in at the strangest times, unexpected bills blindsiding us left and right, and no clue how to save for those huge life goals like a new home or our kids' college education. We were so frustrated and thought, "There must be a better way!" And that's how TerraFin was born.

TerraFin takes a cue from Terraform but is made just for our family's money matters. Just like Terraform, it has this way of letting us lay out what we want in a simple and straightforward way. No getting lost in the details! It makes it a piece of cake to figure out how our finances should be sorted out and keeps everything nice and organized.

Also, TerraFin borrows from Terraform when it comes to keeping a tight rein on our money. It means we can be sure we're spending and saving smartly and making every cent count.

The big difference? Well, Terraform is for something else entirely, but TerraFin is all about the nitty-gritty of our home finances. It helps us come up with plans that fit our family to a T, pays our bills on time without a hitch, saves money where it makes the most sense, and makes sure we don't go crazy in any one area. It's always keeping an eye on our money to make sure everything's on the up and up.

We'll be honest with you â€“ we're not experts in this. We just wanted to find a way to make our financial lives less stressful. But we truly hope that with the help of all you amazing folks out there and the experts who really know their stuff, we can turn TerraFin into something that makes a real difference.

The problems we faced were all over the place. Like not knowing how to save when our jobs were shaky or when a massive medical bill came out of nowhere and wiped out a chunk of our savings. Trying to plan for big life events was like walking in the dark when we couldn't predict our income and expenses accurately. TerraFin is here to be our guiding light through all these challenges.

Let's imagine some real-life situations. Picture having a dashboard that shows you at a glance exactly where your money is going and what you need to do next. Or getting a friendly reminder when you're about to overspend. With TerraFin, you could even have a heart-to-heart chat with someone who gives you spot-on advice about your finances.

Our biggest dream for this is to create a warm and inviting space right here in this GitHub repo where all of you can jump in with your great ideas and help make TerraFin truly spectacular. We can't wait to hear all your thoughts and suggestions and work side by side with you to make it the best it can be.

We're super excited about this journey and can't wait for you to be a part of it!

# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Concept Mapping and Theoretical Validation
At the very beginning, we'll focus on mapping out the core concepts of TerraFin and validating the theoretical foundation through deep research and analysis. We'll be digging into what works and what doesn't, making sure we have a solid base to build on.

## Phase 2: Serving Individuals and Families with Handwritten Notebooks or Excel
In this stage, we'll start small and simple. We'll offer basic financial management tools using things like handwritten notebooks or Excel to help individuals and families get a handle on their finances. It's all about taking those first steps and making a difference in everyday money management.

## Phase 3: Serving Self-Employed Individuals and Micro-Businesses
As we grow, we'll expand our reach to support self-employed folks and micro-businesses. We'll add more features and functionality to meet their specific needs and help them thrive financially.

## Phase 4: Becoming a Professional Enterprise Financial Management Platform
Finally, our ultimate goal is to transform TerraFin into a full-fledged, professional enterprise financial management platform. We want to provide comprehensive and powerful solutions for businesses of all sizes, making financial management a breeze.
